    <p><b>Garena Free Fire</b> is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game played in a third person
        perspective.

        <strong>(bold + emphasis : for search engine)The game consists of up to 50 players falling from a parachute on
            an island</strong> in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose
        their starting position, take weapons and supplies to extend their battle life.

        <i>When players join a game</i>, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the island. While the plane is
        flying over the island, the players can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to
        land away from enemies. <em>(italic + emphasis : helps search engine)After landing, the players must then go
            looking for weapons and utility items</em>. Medical equipment, <small>(small)medium and large
            weapons</small>, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. <mark>The ultimate

        requires <del>eliminating</del> all opponents the players encounter along the way and ensuring that they are

    <h3>Reception</h3>
    <p>The graphics were described as having "a benefit for mid and low specification phones", but a reviewer stated
        that "if games with good graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire Battlegrounds.
        But if you like battle royale games and want to have fun with your friends, you should definitely play."[16]

        Tais Carvalho of TechTudo commented that Free Fire "prioritizes performance, making it a great choice for any
        type of device. The gameplay stands out and has enough content to entertain and offer rewarding combat."
        Regarding the progression of characters and skills, she said it is "a flashy add-on."[17]

        In the Google Play annual list of "Best Apps of the Year", Free Fire won in the "Best Popular Vote Game"
        category of 2019, being the most publicly voted in Brazil and in Thailand.[18][19][20]

        Garena Free Fire is one of the most popular battle royale mobile games, behind PUBG Mobile, Fortnite Battle
        Royale, and Call of Duty: Mobile. It is particularly popular in Latin American, India, and Southeast Asia.[21]
        Free Fire was the fourth most downloaded game on the Google Play Store in the fourth quarter of 2018,[22] and
        was the fourth most downloaded game worldwide in 2018 on iOS and the Google Play Store together.[23] The title
        earned approximately 182 million downloads in 2018, making it the second most downloaded battle royale mobile
        game (above Fortnite Battle Royale and behind only PUBG Mobile),[24] and grossed approximately $19.3 million in
        monthly revenues through December 2018, becoming a significant financial success for Garena.[25][26] As of
        February 2020, Free Fire has 500 million downloads on the Google Play Store.[27]

        At the end of Q1 2021, Free Fire surpassed PUBG Mobile in revenues in the United States, generating $100 million
        in turnover as compared to PUBG's $68 million.[28] Free Fire's revenues jumped by 4.5x as compared to the same
        period for the previous year.[29]
